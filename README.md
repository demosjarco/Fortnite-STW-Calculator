# Fortnite-STW-Calculator

This is an online calculator written in pure JavaScript based on [Whitesushi's Fortnite Loadout](http://epic.gm/yx) spreadsheet. The calculator tab is very useful but the problem is you have to make a copy each time just to use it. And make a new copy everytime he updates it.

So I wanted to make a web page where you could just use the calculator and it would automatically update when he updates his spreadsheet and you can even bookmark a filled out calculator even.
